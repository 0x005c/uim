uim 1.6.0-beta Release Note
======================

About This Release
------------------

This distribution of uim 1.6.0-beta is a preview release for testing
purpose. Since it may contain serious unknown problems, it should not be
used for important work. For such situations, use our latest stable
release uim 1.5.7.

This release achieved both considerable internal improvement and many
user-visible new feature additions.

Notes for Packagers and System Integrators
------------------------------------------

  - The option "--enable-debug" and/or "--enable-backtrace" makes uim (in
    accurately, underlying SigScheme interpreter) quite heavy. Please keep them
    unspecified for normal library

  - Use the bundled SigScheme, and do not depend on external SigScheme
    package. Since the SigScheme interpreter is completely embedded into
    libuim without linking to libsscm, and exposing no SigScheme-specific
    symbols regardless of environment-dependent symbol exportation control
    existence such as -export-symbols of libtool or version script of ld,
    no conflict with libsscm occurs

  - libuim links to libgcroots although SigScheme is embedded into
    libuim. Although libgcroots is also bundled in uim, it should be
    managed as a separated package since both libsscm and libuim which
    provided by separated package depends on it. Add
    '--with-libgcroots=installed' to configure options for uim to disable
    build and install of the bundled version of libgcroots

  - libuim ABI and so libtool-version has been updated due to the
    libuim-scm separation and some API changes


Roadmap
-------

  - uim 1.7.0 and later

    The time for drastic reconstruction. Many user-visible changes.

    The composer framework will be introduced for extensible IM
    development.


  - uim 2.0.0

    Overall uim API will be revised.
