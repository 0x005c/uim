;; composer
;;

;; To minimize memory consumption, composer record has a special field layout.
;; The method table is not stored at index 0 but 4. And index 0-3 is reserved
;; for subclass to hold context specific information. Arbitrary length tail of
;; composer instance can be shared between multiple instances as follows.
;;
;; (define foo-composer-shared-tail (list f2 f3 foo-methods))
;; (define foo-composer-new
;;   (lambda (f0 f1)
;;     (cons f0 (cons f1 foo-composer-shared-tail))))
;;
;; The primary variable 'parent' is relocateable to arbitrary field to support
;; per class different requirements about tail sharing.
;;
;; See comoser-base definitions as actual example.
