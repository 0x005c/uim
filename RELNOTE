uim 1.4.0 Release Note
======================

About This Release
------------------

This distribution of uim 1.4.0 is latest stable release of uim.

This release is for internal improvement. The non-standards-conformant
Scheme interpreter of libuim has been replaced with newly developed
SigScheme to make a room for next leap. There is no user-visible feature
changes other than resource consumption reduction.

Please report us if you find a problem.

What's New
----------

  - Fix the license terms of replace/strsep.c and replace/setenv.c
    accidencially mis-modified in r790. I apologize the careless treatment of
    the license

  - The modified version of SIOD interpreter has been replaced with
    SigScheme 0.7.4

  - [CRITICAL] Fix GC crash on SPARC, IA-64, m68k, and possibly MIPS, Alpha, by
    introduction of libgcroots

See NEWS for the fully detailed changes.


Notes for Packagers and System Integrators
------------------------------------------

  - The option "--enable-debug" and/or "--enable-backtrace" makes uim (in
    accurately, underlying SigScheme interpreter) quite heavy. Please keep them
    unspecified for normal library

  - Use the bundled SigScheme, and do not depend on external SigScheme
    package. Since the SigScheme interpreter is completely embedded into
    libuim without linking to libsscm, and exposing no SigScheme-specific
    symbols regardless of environment-dependent symbol exportation control
    existence such as -export-symbols of libtool or version script of ld,
    no conflict with libsscm occurs

  - libuim links to libgcroots although SigScheme is embedded into
    libuim. Although libgcroots is also bundled in uim, it should be
    managed as a separated package since both libsscm and libuim which
    provided by separated package depends on it. Add
    '--with-libgcroots=installed' to configure options for uim to disable
    build and install of the bundled version of libgcroots

  - libuim ABI and so libtool-version has been updated due to the GC
    protection API change which required to fix the GC problem


Roadmap
-------

  - uim 1.5.0

    Release for internal simplification. Few user-visible changes.

    The complicated C part of uim which prevents extensions, design
    improvements and automated input method tests will be turned into
    Scheme codes or optimized out.


  - uim 1.6.0 and later

    The time for drastic reconstruction. Many user-visible changes.

    The composer framework will be introduced for extensible IM
    development.


Thanks
------

Hans-J. Boehm and all authors of Boehm GC for the useful codes.

Tanaka Akira for letting me realize about the GC problem through the
presentation at Binary 2.0 Conference 2006.
