Roadmap
-------

  - uim 1.4.0

    Release for internal improvement. No user-visible changes other
    than resource consumption reduction. This release plan will not be
    deferred anymore.

    The non-standard-conformant Scheme interpreter of libuim will be
    replaced with newly developed SigScheme to make a room for next
    leap.


  - uim 1.5.0

    Release for internal simplification. No user-visible changes.

    The complicated C part of uim which prevents extensions, design
    improvements and automated input method tests will be turned into
    Scheme codes or optimized out.


  - uim 1.6.0 and later

    The time for drastic reconstruction. Many user-visible changes.

    The composer framework will be introduced for extensible IM
    development.
