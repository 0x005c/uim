Compilation
===========

First, please extract source from tar ball.

      $ tar xvzf uim-x.x.x.tar.gz 

Then, move to the extracted directory and run configure.

      $ cd uim-x.x.x
      $ ./configure 

configure options disabled as default is like this.

    * --enable-debug : build uim with debug information
    * --enable-dict : enable Japanese dictionary tool
    * --with-canna : use Canna
    * --with-qt : build qt tools
    * --with-qt-immodule : build qt immodule. you need the qt with the
                           qt-immodule patch

Finally, make and install it.

      $ make
      $ su
      # make install

By default, uim is installed under /usr/local , but this directory may
not be on the system search path. Should that be the case, add the
line /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.conf and then, run ldconfig.
