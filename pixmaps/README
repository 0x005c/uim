Some icons are imported from scim-imengine-icons 1.0.0 under its
3-clause BSD license. See COPYING of this directory.

  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.jp/scim-imengine/18883/scim-imengine-icons-1.0.0.tar.gz

Other icons are also licensed and reusable under the same BSD
license.

But when you make a new icon or delivertive work based on these icons,
it should also be feedbacked to the scim-imengine project to share the
reusable works. Although these icons are licensed under the BSDL,
original scim-imengine-icons are also offer LGPL as an alternative
license. The dual-license scheme is selected to reduce license
indication botherings by selecting same license of user's own software
package although the BSDL covers all purpose. We should offer same
convenience to the scim-imengine project.
