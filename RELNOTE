Future Direction
----------------

The version 1.0 was bumped as the termination of the development
direction of the ex-leader. After then, the design and development
policies, and thus goals and direction are changed to the new
leader's. Though the 1.1 signals little about the changes, the next
milestones show where we go. It is a way to achieve simple, easily
extensible and high code-quality input method environment.

  - uim 1.3.0

    Release for internal improvement. No user-visible changes other
    than resource consumption reduction.

    The non-standard-conformant Scheme interpreter of libuim will be
    replaced with newly developed SigScheme to make a room for next
    leap.


  - uim 1.4.0

    Release for internal simplification. No user-visible changes.

    The complicated C part of uim which prevents extensions, design
    improvements and automated input method tests will be turned into
    Scheme codes or optimized out.


  - uim 1.5.0 and later

    The time for drastic reconstruction. Many user-visible changes.

    The bridge and IM interface will be revised for better focus and
    reset handlings, and the composer framework will be introduced for
    extensible IM development.
