Release manual for uim
======================

As of this moment, uim has three types of release of the same version.  They
are alpha, beta and final. Alpha may be an unstable release and it may be
untested. After the alpha release, any new big features may not be committed.

The beta release must be tested partially by the maintainer. In the ideal case
it will be well-tested by the maintainer. If a first beta (beta1) is too
unstable, a second beta (beta2) should be released to ensure the quality of
the final release. After beta release, new features may not be committed.

The final release is really the final release. It must be tested well.

For each release the following steps should be followed. To make the final
release, you have to repeat the following procedure at least three times.

1. Declare 'I will make a new release' to the mailing list.

   Committers must not add a new unstable feature if a new release has been
   announced.

2. Gather up details of the release from each committer.

   The ChangeLog of uim is very long, so making a release note from the
   ChangeLog is hard work. Therefore a committer should send details of their
   commit. Maybe we sould prepare a better way.

3. Export a fresh tree from svn.

   svn export http://anonsvn.freedesktop.org/srv/uim/trunk

4. Do a build test with make-dist.sh

   This test is not enough, but worth doing. It is especially useful when a
   new file is added. As a TODO, we should do unit testing at this point.

5. Do test

   This item needs many many description... I must fill this item later.

6. Increment the version number in configure.ac, uim.h and Project-Id-Version
   in po/*.po. Increment libtool-version.mk too if ABI is updated.

7. Tag to tags/x.y.z

   svn cp svn+ssh://svn.freedesktop.org/svn/uim/branches/x.y \
          svn+ssh://svn.freedesktop.org/svn/uim/tags/x.y.z

8. Export the fresh tagged tree from svn.

   svn export http://anonsvn.freedesktop.org/srv/uim/tags/x.y.z

9. Make the distribution.

   cd x.y.z
   ./make-dist.sh

10. Copy the source tarball to http://uim.freedesktop.org/releases

11. Send a message to uim@freedesktop.org.

12. Update the web page.
