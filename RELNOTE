What's New
----------

Following features are highlight of this release. See NEWS for all
changes.

  - icon support for toolbar
  - menu-based quick IM switching from toolbar

And for developers writing uim-related software, there are some major
interface changes must be followed. Please update your codes (with
UIM_VERSION_REQUIRE()).

  - Add icon support to helper protocol
  - Context-originated IM switching of other contexts

See doc/COMPATIBILITY for the details and other compatibility issues.


Notes for Packagers and System Integrators
------------------------------------------

  - Due to the helper protocol incompatibility, 3rd party input-state
    indicators (aka applets) and bridges must be updated to newer
    version that supports the new protocol. Handle version dependency
    carefully

  - Static library building has been disabled by default. Enable it
    explicitly if needed


Future Direction
----------------

The version 1.0 was bumped as the termination of the development
direction of the ex-leader. After then, the design and development
policies, and thus goals and direction are changed to the new
leader's. Though the 1.1 signals little about the changes, the next
milestones show where we go. It is a way to achieve simple, easily
extensible and high code-quality input method environment.

  - uim 1.2.0

    Release for internal improvement. No user-visible changes other
    than resource consumption reduction.

    The non-standard-conformant Scheme interpreter of libuim will be
    replaced with newly developed SigScheme to make a room for next
    leap.


  - uim 1.3.0

    Release for internal simplification. No user-visible changes.

    The complicated C part of uim which prevents extensions, design
    improvements and automated input method tests will be turned into
    Scheme codes or optimized out.


  - uim 1.4.0 and later

    The time for drastic reconstruction. Many user-visible changes.

    The bridge and IM interface will be revised for better focus and
    reset handlings, and the composer framework will be introduced for
    extensible IM development.
