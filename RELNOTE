Following features are highlight of this release. See NEWS for all
changes.

  - All X11 Compose key sequences and user defined one in ~/.XCompose
    are available in gtk+ and Qt bridge.
  - Input-mode and some of the key definition of Japanese
    multi-segment IM have been reorganized.  See "Notes for Anthy,
    Canna, and Mana Users" section.


Notes for Anthy, Canna and Mana Users
-------------------------------------

Now input-mode is reorganized to distinguish on/off state logically.
See figure below about input-mode on Anthy for example.


                              anthy-kana-toggle-key
                                        |
                      +- ja_hiragana  <--+     -+
       anthy-on-key   |                  |      |
                      |  ja_katakana  <--+      |<--+
            -->       |                         |   |
ja_direct             |  ja_halfwidth_katakana -+   | anthy-alkana-toggle-key
            <--       |                             |
                      |  ja_halfwidth_alnum    -+   |
       anthy-off-key  |                         |<--+
                      +- ja_fullwidth_alnum    -+
                      

Users of these IM need to update per-user config with uim-pref.  Here
is the list which is needed to be reconfigured.

  - Key definitions
    - off key
    - convert to halfwidth alphanumeric key
    - convert to fullwidth alphanumeric key
    - convert to halfwidth katakana key
    - halfwidth katakana mode key

  - Input mode menu items in Toolbar
    - Re-enable Halfwidth Katakana, Halfwidth Alphanumeric, Fullwidth
      Alphanumeric mode

Note that "C-j" combination in off key is removed by default, so make
sure to update user config if "C-j" is used as a off key for daily use
(especially uim-fep user).  Also users who customized off key
previously should update the config just after upgrade to 1.2.0.


Note about inputting white space

  - If one set 'ja-direct-rule in ~/.uim to customize the type of
    white space (full-width or half-width) with Japanese mode is on,
    please remove the setting.  In uim 1.2.0, the type of white space
    is defined in 'ja-space.  See comment in japanese.scm.


Future Direction
----------------

  - uim 1.3.0

    Release for internal improvement. No user-visible changes other
    than resource consumption reduction.

    The non-standard-conformant Scheme interpreter of libuim will be
    replaced with newly developed SigScheme to make a room for next
    leap.


  - uim 1.4.0

    Release for internal simplification. No user-visible changes.

    The complicated C part of uim which prevents extensions, design
    improvements and automated input method tests will be turned into
    Scheme codes or optimized out.


  - uim 1.5.0 and later

    The time for drastic reconstruction. Many user-visible changes.

    The bridge and IM interface will be revised for better focus and
    reset handlings, and the composer framework will be introduced for
    extensible IM development.
